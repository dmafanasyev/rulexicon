 Table contains \Sexpr{nrow(rulexicon::hash_sentiment_chen_skiena)} words with non-neutral sentiment scores.
}
\details{
The lexicon was builded on the basis of knowledge graph that connect words in different languages
(based on Wiktionary, Google Translate, transliteration links and WordNet). The authors provide two data files:
one for negative and one for positive words. This polarity table is a joined list after deletion of some artifacts
(36 words in English for which however the translations are in data files).
